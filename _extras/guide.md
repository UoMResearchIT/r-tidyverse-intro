Load [Zoomit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit) beforehand. And check it works - may need to force close and restart. 

## Timing

Leave about 30 minutes at the start of each workshop and another 15 mins
at the start of each session for technical difficulties like WiFi and
installing things (even if you asked students to install in advance, longer if
not).

## Helpers

Remind helpers about voice volume when helping learners when teaching is ongoing.

## Overall

Make sure to emphasize good practices: put code in scripts. Highlight the benefits of
version control and mention the Git course.
Encourage students to create script files for challenges.


Vector recycling and function stacks are probably best explained
with diagrams on a whiteboard.

Be sure to actually go through examples of an R help page: help files
can be intimidating at first, but knowing how to read them is tremendously
useful.

Be sure to show the CRAN task views, look at one of the topics.

There's a lot of content: move quickly through the earlier lessons. Their
extensiveness is mostly for purposes of learning by osmosis: so that their
memory will trigger later when they encounter a problem or some esoteric behaviour.

Don't worry about being correct or knowing the material back-to-front. Use
mistakes as teaching moments: the most vital skill you can impart is how to
debug and recover from unexpected errors.
